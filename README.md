TOPIC/FOCUS: Implementation of the polar questions with clitics in Russian.

# Introduction
The aim of this project is to try to implement the polar questions with a specific focus on the *clitic* in Russian. A __polar question__ is a question that requires a *yes-no answer*. One of the ways to ask such questions in Russian is to change the intonation of declarative sentences or add a clitic *li*. 

## Short description of the phenomena

The phenomenon of yes-no questions in Russian involves many aspects, such as word order, copula, clitics, topic/focus, and constituent structure. We will not consider embedded sentences but focus solely on simple present and past tense questions.

### Word order

Russian shares some features of non-configurational languages, i.e., extensive case system and pro-drop, making it a free word order language. However, King (1993) assumes that the non-configurational properties of Russian are misleading. Word order is not free since it encodes topic and focus information. Instead, King (1993:17) proposes that Russian has __‘SVO’ word order “to which scrambling applies”__.

### Clitic li

Questions with *li* is one of the main constructions with *focus* interpretation. In such questions, the main focus is the questioned element which appears in the left-most position (King 1993). Clitic *li* lets the constituents scramble within the sentence (Butt et al. 2021). The questioned element can be an __NP, PP, AP, or AdvP__. When one of the constituents is an initial element, __it is focused and questioned__. Polar *li* is enclitic, so it __cannot occur in initial sentence position__. 
For instance, in the sentence below the speaker asks about __the book being read__ but not the magazine or newspaper. All the constituents receive their focus reading from clitic *li*.

- *__Knigu li__ on chitaet?* / Is he reading a __book__? or Is it __a book__ that he is reading?

## Challenges and further research

Since in Russian *li* follows the first prosodic word, __clitic placement is solely prosodic__.  The prosody does reorder the constituents to satisfy the prosodic requirement of a clitic (Franks & King 2000:304). This means that the c-structure cannot bear the prosodic requirements of forming constituents but must follow syntactic requirements. Considering that, it is challenging syntactically provide a c-structure which can satisfy both syntactic and prosodic needs.
